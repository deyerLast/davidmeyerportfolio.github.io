        <p>
          Happiness resides not in possessions, and not in gold, happiness dwells in the soul. -Democritus

        <p>
          Memories of our lives, of our works and our deeds will continue in others. -Rosa Parks

        <p>
          I simply want to continue learning as much as I can while solving problems. If I do not know how to do something; simply research until you understand to apply it.
